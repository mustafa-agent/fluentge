გამარჯობა! 👋

I've been working on a free English learning platform made specifically for Georgian speakers. It's called **FluentGe** and it's completely free — no ads, no subscriptions, no hidden costs.

**What's in it:**
- 🃏 65 flashcard decks (3,390+ words with Georgian translations)
- 📖 65 grammar lessons (A1 to C1)
- 🎧 35 podcast episodes (with audio)
- 📚 25 reading passages with comprehension quizzes
- 💬 50 conversation dialogues
- 👂 30 listening exercises
- 🏆 Daily challenge quiz
- 📱 Works on phone (installable as app)

Everything has Georgian translations and explanations. It's built for people who are learning English from scratch or improving their level.

**Try it:** [fluentge.surge.sh](https://fluentge.surge.sh)

I'd love to hear feedback — what features would you want? What's missing? What level are you studying at?
