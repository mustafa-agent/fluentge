## Previous Projects

Tornike has tried:
- TikTok/Temu affiliate videos (had success, currently blocked on Temu)
- Web design freelancing (hard to find customers)
- Online courses with landing pages (low conversion)

This project is different because it targets a real gap in a market he deeply understands.

## Family Context

Tornike is Lasse's brother-in-law. Lasse (who built EasyGeorgian — a Georgian language learning platform) designed this project plan specifically because he believes in Tornike and wants him to succeed. The tech stack and architecture are proven — they work for EasyGeorgian.
