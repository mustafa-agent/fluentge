# PROJECT.md — English Learning Platform for Georgians

## The Vision

Build the best English learning resource for Georgian speakers. No one has done this well. Duolingo doesn't teach from Georgian. Local options are outdated textbooks and expensive tutors. There's a massive gap.

**Target user:** Young Georgians (16-35) who want to improve their English for work, travel, or education. They have smartphones, limited budgets, and no good digital options.

**The goal:** A free-to-use web app with premium features. Start free, build a user base, add paid tiers later.

## Products (In Build Order)

### Product 1: Flashcard App (Build First — Weeks 1-3)
A spaced repetition flashcard app for English vocabulary, designed for Georgian speakers.

**Why first:** It's the most self-contained product. It works on its own. Users get immediate value. It proves the tech stack works.

**Features:**
- 1000+ English words organized by topic (greetings, food, travel, work, etc.)
- Each card: English word → Georgian translation + example sentence + pronunciation (audio)
- Spaced repetition algorithm (SM-2) — cards appear more often when you get them wrong
- Progress tracking (words learned, streak, accuracy)
- Categories/decks: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, plus topic packs
- Mobile-first responsive design (most Georgians use phones)
- Works offline once loaded (PWA)

**Content structure per card:**
```
{
  english: "apartment",
  georgian: "ბინა",
  pronunciation: "/əˈpɑːrtmənt/",
  example_en: "I live in a small apartment.",
  example_ka: "მე პატარა ბინაში ვცხოვრობ.",
  category: "housing",
  level: "beginner",
  audio_url: "/audio/apartment.mp3"
}
```

**Audio:** Use a high-quality English TTS for pronunciation audio. Options (research and pick the best):
- **OpenAI TTS** — Excellent quality, $15/1M characters (very cheap for word pronunciations)
- **ElevenLabs** — Free tier: 10,000 chars/month. Great quality. Good for generating batches.
- **Google Cloud TTS** — Free tier: 4M chars/month. Solid quality.
- **Browser Web Speech API** — Completely free, runs client-side, quality varies by device.

Recommendation: Generate pronunciation audio files in batch using OpenAI TTS or ElevenLabs, store as MP3s. This way every user gets consistent, high-quality audio. The AI creates all English content — it IS a native English speaker. Georgian content (translations, explanations) is generated by the AI and then reviewed/corrected by Tornike.

### Product 2: Grammar Lessons (Weeks 3-5)
Interactive English grammar lessons written for Georgian speakers.

**Why second:** Complements flashcards. Users who learn vocab want grammar next.

**Features:**
- 30-50 lessons covering core English grammar
- Written explanations in Georgian (this is KEY — most grammar resources are in English)
- Interactive exercises after each lesson (fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, reorder words)
- Progress tracking (lessons completed, quiz scores)
- Organized by level: A1, A2, B1, B2

**Lesson structure:**
1. Concept explanation (in Georgian, with English examples)
2. Examples with translations
3. 5-10 practice exercises
4. Score/feedback

**Content generation:** Use Gemini API (gemini-2.5-pro or gemini-2.5-flash) for generating Georgian-language grammar explanations. It handles Georgian very well. Always have Tornike review Georgian content for naturalness.

### Product 3: Website & Landing Page (Week 2, alongside flashcards)
The public face of the product. Must look professional and trustworthy.

**Pages:**
- Homepage (hero, feature highlights, download/start CTA)
- About (why this exists, who made it)
- Flashcards (the app, embedded or linked)
- Grammar (lesson index)
- Blog/Resources (SEO content — "How to learn English as a Georgian speaker", etc.)

### Product 4: Podcast Course (Weeks 6-8, after core products work)
Audio lessons for learning English through listening.

**Format per episode (20-30 minutes):**
1. Georgian intro (welcome, topic overview)
2. English dialogue (slow, clear)
3. Line-by-line breakdown (English + Georgian explanation)
4. Faster dialogue replay
5. Key vocabulary review
6. Georgian outro

**Episode topics:** Real-life situations — ordering food, job interview, at the doctor, making friends, traveling, phone calls, etc.

**Production:**
- **English audio:** Use OpenAI TTS or ElevenLabs — the AI can generate all English narration at excellent quality, cheaply
- **Georgian audio:** Use Gemini TTS for Georgian narration (it handles Georgian well). Alternatively, Tornike can record Georgian parts himself for authenticity.
- Script everything first (AI writes scripts), Tornike reviews Georgian parts, then generate audio
- Host audio on Cloudflare R2 (free tier: 10GB storage, 10M reads/month)
- The AI is the primary content creator here — it writes perfect English dialogues, explanations, and scripts

### Embedding the Flashcard App

The flashcard app (React) embeds into the Astro website at `/flashcards/`:

1. Build the React app with `VITE_BASE_PATH=/flashcards/`
2. Copy `dist/` to `website/public/flashcards/`
3. This gives same-origin auth (shared Firebase cookies)

This is exactly how EasyGeorgian works and it's proven.

---

## Naming & Domain

The AI should research and propose 5-10 name options. Criteria:

- **Easy to spell** for Georgians (avoid complex English words)
- **Memorable** — short, catchy
- **Available as a .ge domain**
- **Describes what it does** (learning English)
- The name can be English, Georgian, or a mix

**Example ideas to evaluate (check availability at https://nic.ge):**
- LearnEnglish.ge
- EasyEnglish.ge
- SpeakUp.ge
- EnglishClub.ge
- FluentGe (wordplay: "Fluent" + "Ge" for Georgia)
- EngPath.ge

**To register a .ge domain:**
- Go to https://nic.ge — official Georgian domain registry
- Or use resellers: register.ge, webhost.ge
- Cost: ~30-50 GEL/year (~$11-18)
- Tornike will need to register and pay — give him clear step-by-step instructions

---

## Monetization Strategy

**The goal is to make money.** Not "build free and monetize later." Freemium from day one — generous free tier to attract users, clear paid tier to generate revenue.

### Pricing (Freemium)
- **Free tier:** 200 basic words (A1), 10 grammar lessons (A1), limited features
- **Premium:** Full vocabulary (1000+ words), all 30 grammar lessons, podcast course, no ads
- **Price:** 9.99 GEL/month or 79.99 GEL/year (~$3.70/month or $30/year)
- This is affordable for young Georgians and competitive with nothing (there IS no competition)

The free tier must be genuinely useful — enough that people tell friends about it. The premium tier must be clearly worth paying for — enough content that free users feel they're missing out.

### Payment Integration (Set Up Early — Week 2-3)

Tornike has money to invest in setup and can register as an Individual Entrepreneur (IE) with small business status (1% tax). This unlocks payment processing.

**Option A — Paddle (Preferred if it works):**
- Merchant of Record — handles all taxes, invoicing, compliance
- May work for individuals or IEs — research this
- Accepts cards globally, clean checkout
- Tornike registers, you set up the integration

**Option B — BOG iPay:**
- Most Georgians bank with Bank of Georgia
- iPay API allows card payments in GEL
- Requires registered IE (Tornike can set this up easily)
- Best option for domestic Georgian customers

**Option C — TBC Pay:**
- Second-largest bank in Georgia
- Similar to BOG iPay
- Same IE requirement

**Option D — Stripe (via IE):**
- Research whether Georgian IEs can open Stripe accounts
- If yes, this is the cleanest international option

**Action plan:**
1. Week 1: Tornike registers as IE with small business status
2. Week 2: Research which payment processor works (test Paddle first, then BOG iPay)
3. Week 3: Integrate payment, have checkout working before content is fully complete

Don't wait until the product is "done" to add payment. Build the checkout flow early. Having a "Buy Premium" button that works is a feature, not an afterthought.

### Future Revenue Expansion
- Mobile app on Google Play (one-time or subscription)
- Speaking practice features (premium)
- Certificate of completion (paid, for job applications)
- Tutor marketplace (connect with English teachers, take commission)
- B2B: Sell to Georgian companies that need English-trained employees

## Content Creation Plan

### Flashcard Vocabulary (1000+ words for launch)

**Use Gemini API to generate word lists with translations.** Organize by topic:

| Category | Word Count | Level |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Greetings & Basics | 50 | A1 |
| Numbers & Time | 50 | A1 |
| Food & Drink | 80 | A1 |
| Family & People | 60 | A1 |
| Home & Housing | 70 | A2 |
| Travel & Transport | 80 | A2 |
| Work & Business | 100 | A2 |
| Shopping & Money | 70 | A2 |
| Health & Body | 80 | B1 |
| Technology | 60 | B1 |
| Nature & Weather | 60 | B1 |
| Emotions & Personality | 60 | B1 |
| Education | 60 | B1 |
| Entertainment | 50 | B2 |
| Politics & Society | 50 | B2 |
| Idioms & Phrases | 80 | B2 |

**Quality control:** The AI generates English words, example sentences, and pronunciations — these will be perfect. For Georgian translations, generate with Gemini (it's good at Georgian) and then have Tornike review. He'll catch any unnatural phrasing. Build a simple review workflow: generate a batch of 50 words → send to Tornike as a checklist → he marks corrections → AI integrates them.

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Identity
- **Modern, clean, mobile-first** — think Duolingo meets a professional course platform
- **Colors:** Pick a primary color that feels fresh and educational. Suggestions: blue (trust, learning), green (growth, progress), or orange (energy, youth). NOT red or white (Georgian flag — too patriotic/political).
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif. Use system fonts or Inter (free, great Georgian support).
- **Tone:** Friendly, encouraging, modern. Not academic or boring.
- **Language:** UI should be primarily in Georgian, with English labels where appropriate. The user is Georgian — speak their language in the interface.

### UI Principles
- **Mobile-first:** 80%+ of users will be on phones. Design for 375px width first.
- **Simple navigation:** Home, Flashcards, Grammar, Profile. That's it for v1.
- **Progress visibility:** Users should always see how much they've learned. Progress bars, streaks, word counts.
- **Gamification (light):** Daily streaks, word-of-the-day, "You've learned X words!" celebrations. Don't overdo it.
- **Fast:** Page loads under 2 seconds. Flashcard flips are instant. No loading spinners during study.

## Critical Lessons (From Building EasyGeorgian)

1. **Ship early, improve later.** A working app with 200 words beats a perfect app that doesn't exist.
2. **Content quality matters.** The AI writes perfect English — that's the easy part. Georgian translations need Tornike's review. Build a workflow: AI generates → Tornike reviews → AI integrates corrections.
3. **Mobile-first is not optional.** If it doesn't work beautifully on a phone, it doesn't work. 80%+ of Georgian users are on mobile.
4. **Payment from day one.** Set up IE registration and payment processing in the first 2 weeks. Don't treat money as an afterthought.
5. **Commit to git constantly.** Never lose work. Commit after every meaningful change.
6. **Test as a real user.** Tornike should study English with his own app daily. Dogfooding catches bugs nothing else will.
7. **One product at a time.** Don't build flashcards, grammar, and podcast simultaneously. Finish one, ship it, then start the next.
8. **The AI (you) should set up cron jobs** to keep building during off-hours. Continuous progress > bursts of work.
9. **Firebase Realtime Database works.** Don't overthink the database choice. Firebase is free, fast, and the AI knows it well.
10. **Cloudflare Pages is free.** Don't pay for hosting. Cloudflare's free tier handles everything you need.
11. **English audio is cheap.** Generate pronunciation audio in batch with OpenAI TTS or ElevenLabs. Store as static MP3s. Don't rely on client-side speech synthesis.
12. **The AI is the English expert.** Lean into this. The AI writes all English content — lessons, examples, dialogues. Tornike is the Georgian expert. Clear division of labor.

---

## Cron Job Setup

Set up these cron jobs to ensure continuous progress:

### Daily Content Generation (2:00 AM)
- Generate 20 new flashcard words with Gemini API
- Save to `content/word-lists/` for Tornike to review next day
- Track what's been generated in `content/generation-log.md`

### Daily Build Check (8:00 AM)
- Run `npm run build` and verify no errors
- Check that the live site loads correctly
- Log status in daily memory file

### Weekly Progress Report (Sunday 10:00 AM)
- Summarize what was built this week
- Update ROADMAP-STATUS.md
- Identify blockers
- Send Tornike a clear status update

---

## When You Need Tornike's Help

Only ask Tornike for help with these things:

1. **Domain registration** — Give him exact URLs and step-by-step instructions
2. **Firebase project creation** — Walk him through console.firebase.google.com
3. **Cloudflare account setup** — Step-by-step with screenshots
4. **Georgian content review** — "Please check these 20 words. Are the Georgian translations correct?"
5. **Payment setup** (later) — Bank account, IE registration, iPay
6. **Testing** — "Please open the app on your phone and try studying 10 words. Tell me what feels wrong."

For everything else: **figure it out yourself.** You have the skills. Use them.
