From Ethiopia, coffee spread to the Arab world. The first coffeehouses opened in the Middle East in the 15th century. They became important social places where people discussed politics, business, and philosophy. Coffee reached Europe in the 17th century and quickly became popular.

Today, coffee is grown in more than 70 countries. Brazil is the largest producer, followed by Vietnam and Colombia. The coffee industry employs over 125 million people worldwide.

While AI offers tremendous benefits, it also raises profound ethical questions that society must address.

One major concern is algorithmic bias. AI systems learn from historical data, which often contains existing prejudices related to race, gender, and socioeconomic status. If these biases are not identified and corrected, AI can perpetuate and even amplify discrimination. For example, studies have shown that some facial recognition systems are significantly less accurate when identifying people with darker skin tones.

Another critical issue is the impact on employment. As AI becomes capable of performing tasks previously done by humans — from driving trucks to analyzing legal documents — millions of jobs could be displaced. While new jobs will certainly emerge, the transition period could be painful for many workers who lack the skills needed for the new economy.

Privacy is also a growing concern. AI-powered surveillance systems can track individuals' movements, analyze their behavior, and predict their actions. This capability, while useful for security purposes, can easily be misused by authoritarian governments or corporations.

We can communicate instantly across continents, access entertainment from any country, and travel more easily than ever before. However, this interconnectedness raises important questions about cultural identity and the preservation of local traditions.

Critics of globalization argue that it leads to cultural homogenization — the process by which local cultures become more similar to one another, often dominated by Western, particularly American, culture. Fast food chains replace local restaurants, Hollywood movies overshadow local cinema, and English threatens to displace smaller languages.

Georgia offers an interesting case study. Despite centuries of foreign influence — from Persian and Ottoman rule to Soviet domination — Georgians have maintained a remarkably strong cultural identity. The Georgian alphabet, one of only 14 unique alphabets in the world, has survived for over 1,500 years. Georgian polyphonic singing is recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage. Traditional winemaking using clay vessels called qvevri has been practiced for 8,000 years.

However, even in Georgia, the influence of globalization is visible. Young Georgians increasingly consume international media, and English words are entering everyday Georgian speech. The challenge lies in finding a balance — embracing the benefits of global connectivity while preserving the unique traditions that define who we are.

Understanding how our brains make decisions can help us make better ones.

Psychologist Daniel Kahneman, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics, proposed that humans have two thinking systems. System 1 is fast, automatic, and emotional. It handles routine decisions without conscious effort. System 2 is slow, deliberate, and logical. It activates when we face complex problems that require careful analysis.

The problem is that we often rely on System 1 when we should be using System 2. This leads to cognitive biases — systematic errors in thinking that affect our judgments. For example, the anchoring effect means we are heavily influenced by the first piece of information we receive, even if it is irrelevant. The confirmation bias makes us seek information that supports our existing beliefs while ignoring contradicting evidence.

Another fascinating phenomenon is decision fatigue. Research shows that the quality of our decisions deteriorates as we make more of them throughout the day. This is why many successful leaders, including Steve Jobs, simplified their daily choices — wearing the same outfit every day, for instance — to save mental energy for important decisions.

Awareness of these psychological patterns is the first step toward better decision-making. By recognizing when our thinking might be biased, we can pause, engage System 2, and make more rational choices.`,words:240,questions:[{q:"What is Kahneman's 'System 1'?",opts:["Slow and logical","Fast, automatic, and emotional","Only for important decisions","A computer system"],ans:1},{q:"What is the 'anchoring effect'?",opts:["Being influenced heavily by the first information received","Always choosing the safest option","Making decisions based on emotions","Following other people's choices"],ans:0},{q:"Why did Steve Jobs wear the same outfit daily?",opts:["Fashion preference","To save money","To save mental energy for important decisions","Company policy"],ans:2}]},{id:"b2-4",level:"B2",title:"Digital Privacy in Modern Society",titleKa:"ციფრული კონფიდენციალურობა თანამედროვე საზოგადოებაში",text:`In the digital age, our personal data has become one of the most valuable commodities in the world. Every time we browse the internet, use social media, or make an online purchase, we generate data that companies collect, analyze, and monetize.

Tech giants like Google and Facebook build detailed profiles of their users based on search history, location data, social connections, and online behavior. This information is used primarily for targeted advertising — showing users ads that are specifically tailored to their interests and habits. The result is a highly profitable business model where the product being sold is essentially the users' attention and personal information.

Government surveillance adds another dimension to the privacy debate. Intelligence agencies in many countries have the capability to monitor communications on a massive scale. While proponents argue that this is necessary for national security, critics warn that unchecked surveillance power can be used to suppress political dissent and violate civil liberties.

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), implemented in 2018, represents the most comprehensive attempt to protect digital privacy. It gives EU citizens the right to know what data companies collect about them, the right to have their data deleted, and requires companies to obtain explicit consent before collecting personal information.

However, research in the field of happiness economics has challenged this conventional wisdom, revealing a far more complex relationship between money and life satisfaction.

The Easterlin Paradox, first described by economist Richard Easterlin in 1974, observes that while wealthier individuals within a country tend to be happier than poorer ones, increasing a country's overall wealth does not necessarily make its citizens happier. This suggests that relative income — how your income compares to those around you — matters more than absolute income.

Research consistently identifies several factors that contribute more to happiness than wealth: strong social relationships, meaningful work, good health, and a sense of purpose. Scandinavian countries regularly top global happiness rankings not because they are the richest, but because they have strong social safety nets, high levels of trust, work-life balance, and relatively low inequality.

Georgia ranks in the middle of global happiness surveys. While economic challenges exist, Georgian culture's emphasis on family, friendship, hospitality, and communal celebration provides a strong foundation for life satisfaction. The tradition of the supra — the Georgian feast — exemplifies how Georgian culture prioritizes social connection and shared joy.
